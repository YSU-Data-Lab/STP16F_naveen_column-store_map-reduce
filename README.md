2016 Fall Student Project 

Naveen Thumma 

Mr. Thumma did a project to run the TBAT (Timestamped Binary Association Table) vs BAT update experiments in a Map-Reduce environment. The aim is for write-optimization of column-store databases on big data. He performed update tests on 1GB, 10GB, and 20GB data sets in HDFS.
